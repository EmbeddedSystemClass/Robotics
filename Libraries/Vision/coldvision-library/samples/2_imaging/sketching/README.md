### What is this repository for? ###

* This prototype tests implementations of the pencil sketch operation for images and videos using C++, CUDA, OpenCV 3.X.

A sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: 
it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or  it might be used as a quick way of 
graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle.
