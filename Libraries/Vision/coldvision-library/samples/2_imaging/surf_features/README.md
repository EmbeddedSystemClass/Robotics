### What is this repository for? ###

* This prototype tests different implementations of the real-time feature-based object detection with SURF, KNN, FLANN, OpenCV 3.X and CUDA.

Object detection is the process of finding instances of real-world objects such as faces, bicycles, and buildings in images or videos. 
Object detection algorithms typically use extracted features and learning algorithms to recognize instances of an object category. 
It is commonly used in applications such as image retrieval, security, surveillance, and automated vehicle parking systems.

It is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision and a lot of techniques have come up to solve it, including Feature-based object detection, 
Viola-Jones object detection, SVM classification with histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) features and Image segmentation and blob analysis. 
Other methods for detecting objects with computer vision include using gradient-based, derivative-based, and template matching approaches. 
More details can be found in this post.

This post is about testing of the SURF algorithm, the FLANN based matcher (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors), 
and their OpenCV 3.x CPU and GPU/CUDA implementations. The SURF algorithm falls into the first category Feature-based object detection.
