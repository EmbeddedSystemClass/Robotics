### What is this repository for? ###

* This prototype tests the image segmentation with several Watershed-based algorithms, including the marker-controlled variation 
provided by OpenCV 3.X, with the graph-based variation Power Watershed implemented in C++, with the unified version of waterfalls, 
standard and P algorithms implemented in C++, and with a marker-controlled variation implemented in CUDA similar to the one provided by OpenCV..

In computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments. 
The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. 
Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. More precisely, image segmentation is 
the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.
