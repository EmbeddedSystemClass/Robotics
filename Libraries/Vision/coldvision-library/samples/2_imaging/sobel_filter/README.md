### What is this repository for? ###

* This prototype tests different implementations of the image gradient using the Sobel operator, C++, CUDA, OpenCV 3.X.

An image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image. Image gradients may be used to extract information from images. 
In graphics software for digital image editing, the term gradient or color gradient is used for a gradual blend of color which can be considered 
as an even gradation from low to high values, as used from white to black in the images to the right. Another name for this is color progression.
