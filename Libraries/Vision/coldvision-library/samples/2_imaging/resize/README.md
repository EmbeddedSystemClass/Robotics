### What is this repository for? ###

* This prototype implements and tests different downsampling algorithms of grayscale and color images to any size using C++, CUDA, OpenCV 3.X.
In image analysis downsampling is a fundamental transformation to significantly decrease the processing time with little or no errors introduced into the system.
Several algorithms exist, from simple skipping pixels which results in aliased images to more sophisticated reduction kernels with decrease in speed. Popular image processing libraries such OpenCV implement it as a simple geometric transformation like pixel area relation where areas are shrunk independently.
