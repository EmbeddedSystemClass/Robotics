### What is this repository for? ###

* This prototype tests different implementations of the histogram calculation for images using C++, CUDA, OpenCV 3.X.

An image histogram is a type of histogram that acts as a graphical representation of the tonal distribution in a digital image. 
It plots the number of pixels for each tonal value. 
By looking at the histogram for a specific image a viewer will be able to judge the entire tonal distribution at a glance.
