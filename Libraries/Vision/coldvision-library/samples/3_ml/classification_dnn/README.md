### What is this repository for? ###

* This prototype tests different implementations of the image classification with Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Caffe, OpenCV 3.x and CUDA.

Topics covered:

* Image Classification, Neural Networks vs Deep Learning, CNN vs R-CNN, cuDNN, Caffe, ImageNet & challenges
* Testing of OpenCVâ€™s DNN CPU classification using GoogLeNet, a trained network from Caffe model zoo
* Testing of Caffe CPU and GPU/CUDA classification using the same GoogLeNet model
* Building, training and testing of own Caffe CNN model starting from the Oxford 102 category flower dataset
* Deployment and testing on NVIDIA Tegra K1
* Installation and development in Ubuntu
